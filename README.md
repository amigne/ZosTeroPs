# ZosTeroPs
  
Zosterops is a genus of passerine birds containing the typical white-eyes in  the white-eye family Zosteropidae. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zosterops))  
  
But **Z**os**T**ero**P**s is a **ZTP** (*Zero Touch Provisioning*) server that aims to support provisioning of devices on different platforms from different vendors.

It's a current WIP (*Work In Progress*) project, but it's expected to be fully operational and to include more and more advanced features as the development progresses. I have adopted an incremental development approach: It is expected to have a minimal working platform in the early development stage, with the addition of more advanced and customizing features over the time.

**ZosTeroPs** is a web system developed in Python using the Django framework.

And now, give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar: The idea of developing ZosTeroPs is consecutive to the discover of the [Tim Dorssers' ZTP project](https://github.com/tdorssers/ztp). This may explain some resemblance of the GUI or some code reuse. Tim's work as well as ZosTeroPs are both under MIT license.
